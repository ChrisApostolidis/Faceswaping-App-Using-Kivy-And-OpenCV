# Faceswaping-App-Using-Kivy-And-OpenCV

This project was developed as my diplomatic project for the Bachelor degree in Computer Science of the Computer Science and Telecommunications department of University Of Thessaly in Lamia, Greece.

Most of the code used for the faceswaping functions was either developed following the tutorial, or downloaded and refactored as necessary, from this link: https://pysource.com/2019/04/04/face-swapping-opencv-with-python-part-1/

In order for the app to run, it needs one more file, which can be found on: https://github.com/AKSHAYUBHAT/TensorFace/blob/master/openface/models/dlib/shape_predictor_68_face_landmarks.dat

The GUI was developed using the Kivy library.
