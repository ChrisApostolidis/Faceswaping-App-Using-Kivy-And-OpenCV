# Faceswaping-App-Using-Kivy-And-OpenCV

This project was developed as my diplomatic essay for the Bachelor degree in Computer Science of the Computer Science and Telecommunications department of University Of Thessaly in Lamia, Greece.

Most of the code used for the faceswaping functions was either developed following the tutorial, or downloaded and refactored as necessary, from this online repository: https://pysource.com/2019/04/04/face-swapping-opencv-with-python-part-1/

The GUI was developed using the Kivy library.
